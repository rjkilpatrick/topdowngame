# Top Down Game

An unimaginative title for a testbed for learning Godot.
As a result, this many remain an unplayable / no reason to play game with a messy commit history and that's okay.

## About

It's been [a while](https://github.com/rjkilpatrick/BrickFPS/commit/6c8351cce40567a2e3b5d1c02025e75c6e2d0ba2) since I last used Godot engine and as a result, I have largely forgotten how it works.
I've decided to rectify this with a small top down shooter.

Hopefully this will give me a place to experiment with the engine and learn some shader programming, etc.

## Scope

The game is a top down shooter.

The idea is that enemies continuously spawn and you have to last as long as possible, with the difficulty continually ramping up (I am not sure yet how to increase 'difficulty' for the player).
